##### CIDR

- 10.0.0.0/8 (Class A) 256^3 hosts
= 10.0.0.0 network

- subnets
- 192.168/27 (8.8.8.3) => 2^3 = 8 subnets
- 32 - 27 = 5 => 2^5 = 32 hosts per subnet

##### VCN

- Private IPs; 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16
- OCI => range from /16 (256^2 hosts) to /30 (2^6 subnets with 2^2 hosts each)
- OCI => reserves first 2 and last IPs (3 IPs!)

- Regional services (spans all over the region with or without multiple ADs)
- Subnet can be AD specific or regional
- Subnet Private => only Private IPs
- Subnet Public => contains both Private and Public IPs
- VNIC => Virtual Network Interface Card connects resources (instances) to the VCN as endpoints

##### IP Adresses

- Every instance will get a mandatory Private IP inside a subnet (Primary VNIC)
- A primary VNIC has a primary private IP and 31 private secondary IPs
- Instances can have a secondary VNIC (connected to different subnets/VCNs)
- Public IPs are optional
- Possible to assign a given resource multiple public IPs across one or more VNICs
- Public IP Ephemeral => temp, instance lifetime. Assigned only to primary private IP
- Public IP Reserved => persitent, can be assigned/reassigned (31 times)
